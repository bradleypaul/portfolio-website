Live site (here)[https://bradleypaul.github.io/portfolio-website/] 

## Local use
clone the repo (git clone) and either run with a local server (ISS express, nginx) or load the index html file directly.

### Work in progress
Ran out of time due to extenuating circumstances. Would love to improve the look and feel using the GitHub api to pull in my 
projects by last commited and have their specific photo blocks be based on that.
