            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?
                I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith,
                so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge
                of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to
                many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his
                power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his
                apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's <i>ironic</i> he could save others from death, but not himself.

            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an
                internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives
                you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
